## Before You Get Started!

Welcome! For those of you looking to get started with the V0 chat, the AI Component Generator tool, I have compiled this list of resources. I hope you find it helpful!

A bit about me: I’ve spent the last 5 years immersed in the ML and full-stack application space, with a recent focus on building type-safe applications using Next.js, Shadcn/UI, and Tailwind CSS. The Shadcn UI library and V0 have revolutionized my workflow, and I highly recommend checking them out. This is going to shape the frontend landscape for the coming years.

### What is V0 Chat?

V0 Chat is an AI-powered chatbot that generates frontend components for your applications. Just type in what you want to create, and the AI will generate the code for you. It’s that simple!

If you're already comfortable with Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and Shadcn components, V0 Chat will feel like a natural extension of your workflow.

However, if you're new to these technologies, don't worry! I've compiled a list of starter resources to help you get up to speed👇. You’ll also find a curated collection of awesome Shadcn components and community-built resources to inspire you and take your development skills to the next level.
