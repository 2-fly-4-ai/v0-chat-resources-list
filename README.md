## Before You Get Started!

Welcome! For those of you looking to get started with the V0 chat, the AI Component Generator tool, I have compiled this list of resources. I hope you find it helpful!

A bit about me: Iâ€™ve spent the last 5 years immersed in the ML and full-stack application space, with a recent focus on building type-safe applications using Next.js, Shadcn/UI, and Tailwind CSS. The Shadcn UI library and V0 have revolutionized my workflow, and I highly recommend checking them out. This is going to shape the frontend landscape for the coming years.

### What is V0 Chat?

V0 Chat is an AI-powered chatbot that generates frontend components for your applications. Just type in what you want to create, and the AI will generate the code for you. Itâ€™s that simple!

If you're already comfortable with Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and Shadcn components, V0 Chat will feel like a natural extension of your workflow.

However, if you're new to these technologies, don't worry! I've compiled a list of starter resources to help you get up to speedðŸ‘‡. Youâ€™ll also find a curated collection of awesome Shadcn components and community-built resources to inspire you and take your development skills to the next level.
